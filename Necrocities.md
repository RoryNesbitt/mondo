# Necromancer Cities
There are horror stories told of these towns but they in fact just have a
different outlook on what life is. When a town member dies their body is
reanimated and used for manual labour such as farming.  
Though the dead get no personal benifit from it, they will be told to stop work
by the doctor in charge if the family wish to visit them. These people all
know that work is what waits for them after they die and they do not take issue
the same way that those of bigger cities would, here the dead simply outnumber
the living and this is the only way for them to survive.
