# Doctors

Doctors originate from the necro cities but have decided to travel the land so
they can help cure more people of their infections, diseases, and personalities.

Stories of a doctor coming to town travels quick as they are easily spotted in
their long, wax coated robes and bone like masks with the long beaks. They are
wonderfully skilled and will always guaruntee to cure someone of whatever ales
them, for a fee. This help may not be appreciated however, as the persons body
will return disease free but their soul may not survive the surgury.  
To the doctor this is a successful operation and should be charged as such, they
have nought but good intentions when doing this, and if possible they will,
reluctantly, save the persons personality, but if it cannot be done well, a body
is still a body and a cure is always successful.

Though not all doctors view personality as something to be fixed, those who do
tend to leave a lasting impact on the people they meet and therefore the stories
of such figures travel more than others. Most in fact are aware that their view
on death is not widely accepted and that people from bigger cities may not
appreciate having a parent returned without their soul. These that have accepted
this view may even remove their robes and mask so to not cause the same fear
their peers inflict. Though their specialities still lay the same.
